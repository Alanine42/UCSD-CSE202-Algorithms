\problem{3: Minimum Cost Sum} % {10+10+10+20=50}

\problemdes

You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ of nonnegative integers, where $n \geq 1$. You are allowed to take any two numbers and add them to produce their sum. However, each such addition has a cost which is equal to the sum. The goal is to the find the sum of all the numbers in the sequence with minimum total cost. Describe an algorithm for finding the sum of the numbers in the sequence with minimum total cost. Argue the correctness of your algorithm.
