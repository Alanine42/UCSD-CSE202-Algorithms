\problem{2: Business plan} % {10+10+10+20=50}

\problemdes

Consider the following problem. You are designing the business plan for a start-up company. You have identified $n$ possible projects for your company, and for, $1 \leq i \leq n$, let $c_i > 0$ be the minimum capital required to start the project $i$ and $p_i > 0$ be the profit after the project is completed. You also know your initial capital $C_0 > 0$. You want to perform at most $k$, $1 \leq i \leq n$, projects before the IPO and want to maximize your total capital at the IPO. Your company cannot perform the same project twice.

In other words, you want to pick a list of up to k distinct projects, $i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k^{\prime}}$ with $k^{\prime} \leq k$. Your accumulated capital after completing the project $i_j$ will be $C_{j}=C_{0}+\sum_{h=1}^{h=j} p_{i_{h}}$. The sequence must satisfy the constraint that you have sufficient capital to start the project $i_{j+1}$ after completing the first $j$ projects, i.e.,$C_j \geq c_{i_{j+1}}$ for each $j=0, \dots, k^{\prime}-1$.You want to maximize the final amount of capital, $C_{k^{\prime}}$.
