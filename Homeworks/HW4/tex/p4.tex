\problem{4: Maximum coverage} % {10+10+10+20=50}

\problemdes

The maximum coverage problem is the following: Given a universe $U$ of $n$ elements, with nonnegative weights specified, a collection of subsets of $U, S_1, \dots,S_l$, and an integer $k$, pick $k$ sets so as to maximize the weight of elements covered. Show that the obvious algorithm, of greedily picking the best set in each iteration until $k$ sets are picked, achieves an approximation factor of $\left(1-(1-1 / k)^{k}\right)>(1-1 / e)$.
