\problem{1: Maximum weight subtree} % {10+10+10+20=50}

\problemdes

The maximum weight subtree is as follows. You are given a tree $T$ together with (not necessarily positive) weights $w(i)$ for each node $i \in T$. A subtree of $T$ is any connected subgraph of $T$, (so a subtree is not necessarily the entire subtree rooted at a node). You wish to find a subtree of $T$ that maximizes $\sum_{i \in S} w(i)$. Design an efficient algorithm for solving this problem. Note that there is a linear (in the number of nodes of the tree) time algorithm for this problem. You can assume that for each node in the tree $T$, you are given a list of its children as well as the parent pointer (except for the root node).
