\problem{3: Scheduling in a medical consulting firm} % {10+10+10+20=50}

\problemdes

You’ve periodically helped the medical consulting firm Doctors Without Weekends on various hospital scheduling issues, and they’ve just come to you with a new problem. For each of the next $n$ days, the hospital has determined the number of doctors they want on hand; thus, on day $i$, they have a requirement that exactly $p_i$ doctors be present.

There are $k$ doctors, and each is asked to provide a list of days on which he or she is willing to work. Thus doctor $j$ provides a set $L_j$ of days on which he or she is willing to work.

The system produced by the consulting firm should take these lists and try to return to each doctor $j$ a list $L_j^{\prime},$ with the following properties.

(A) $L_j^{\prime},$ is a subset of $L_j$, so that doctor $j$ only works on days he or she finds acceptable.

(B) If we consider the whole set of lists $L_{1}^{\prime}, \ldots, L_{k}^{\prime}$, it causes exactly $p_i$ doctors to be present on day $i$, for $i = 1,2,\dots,n$.

\subproblem{Subproblem 1}

Describe a polynomial-time algorithm that implements this system. Specifically, give a polynomial- time algorithm that takes the numbers $p_1,p_2, \dots, p_n$, and the lists $L_1,\dots,L_k$, and does one of the following two things.

\begin{itemize}
\item Return lists $L_{1}^{\prime}, \ldots, L_{k}^{\prime}$ satisfying properties (A) and (B); or
\item Report (correctly) that there is no set of lists $L_{1}^{\prime}, \ldots, L_{k}^{\prime}$ that satisfies both properties (A) and (B).
\end{itemize}
