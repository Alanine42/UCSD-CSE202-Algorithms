Consider the problem of selecting nodes for a cellular network. Any number of nodes can be chosen from a finite set of potential locations. We know the benefit $b_i \geq 0$ of establishing site i. However, if sites i and j are selected as nodes, then the benefit is offset by $c_{ij}$, which is the cost of interference between the two nodes. Both the benefits and costs are non-negative integers. Find an efficient algorithm to determine the subset of sites as the nodes for the cellular network such that the sum of the node benefits less the interference costs is as large as possible.

Design an efficient polynomial-time algorithm.

Provide a high-level description of your algorithm, prove its correctness, and analyze its time complexity.
