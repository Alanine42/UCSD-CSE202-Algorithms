Devise as efficient as possible algorithm for the following problem. You have n remote sensors $s_i$ and $m < n$ base stations $B_j$. For $1 \le j \le m$, base station $B_j$ is located at $(x_j,y_j)$ in the two-dimensional plane. You are given that no two base-stations are less than 1 km apart (in standard Euclidean distance, $\sqrt{\left(\left(x_{j}-x_{k}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{j}-y_{k}\right)^{2}\right)})$. All base stations have the same integer bandwidth capacity $C$.

For $1 \le i \le n$, sensor $s_i$ is located at $(x_i, y_i)$ in the two-dimensional plane and has an integer bandwidth requirement of $r_i$, which can be met by assigning bandwidth on multiple base stations. Let $b_{i,j}$ be the amount of bandwidth assigned to sensor $s_i$ on base station $B_j$. The assignment must meet the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}
\item No sensor may be assigned any bandwidth on a base station more than 2 km distance from it, i.e., if the distance from $s_i$ to $B_j$ is greater than $2$, $b_{i,j} = 0$.
\item The sum of all the bandwidth assigned to any remote sensor $s_i$ must be at least $r_i$: for each $1 \leq i \leq n$, $\sum_{j} b_{i, j} \geq r_{i}$.
\item The sum of all bandwidth assigned on base station $B_j$ must be at most $C$: for each $1 \leq j \leq m$, $\sum_{i} b_{i, j} \leq C$.
\end{itemize}

Your algorithm should find a solution meeting the above constraints if possible, and otherwise output a message saying “No solution exists”. Prove the correctness of your algorithm and discuss its time complexity.
